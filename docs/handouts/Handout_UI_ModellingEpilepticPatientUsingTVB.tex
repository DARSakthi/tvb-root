\begin{abstract}
\noindent A small paragraph that gives context to the session, that is, 
why we are modeling this particular case.\\
The aim is to model specific patients whos data we get from neuroimaging methods and to reproduce one or several modalities . then we can try 
1) to ifind epileptogenic regions (concorance with data) 
2) to model chirugy cases and impact on the conectomr

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}
from clinical point of view, see summary
The main goal of this session is to provide a clear understanding of how wen can put apatient i tvb, model the different modalities and perform soe anaylis on the results and/or export the results

Furthemore, we probably need to provide one or two references about relevant
empirical studies ...


\subsection{What's inside Project X }\label{sec:project_data}

The table should list the data inside a project. 
We provide data for simulation taken from the Human Connectom Project. Data were handled with the pipeline described earlier today.

% let's start a new thought -- a new section

\newthought{In this session}, we'll only go through the necessary steps
required to reproduce the data described in Table~\ref{tab:margintab}.
Describe some particularities of the project. 


\subsection{Steps: importing the data}\label{sec:import}

In your browser go to the tab that says \textsc{project}.
Figure~\ref{fig:fig} shows a snapshots of this working area.
At first step, we will import all the relevant modaliites.

A little word on the pipeline here.

Show how to import data

As a first step, you we will explore {\color{RoyalBlue}\textsc{A}}. Then, we
will do {\color{RoyalBlue} \textsc{B}} to achieve
{\color{RoyalBlue} \textsc{C}}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do this,
\item and that,
\item Did you get that? Then proceed with the next step
\item ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Steps: exploring the epileptor model}\label{sec:epileptor}

we will look at the phase space of the epileptor model, understanding a bit what is the underlying dynamics

\subsection{Steps: Preparing a region parameter exploration }

we test several hypothesis on the position of the epileptogenic zone

\subsection{Steps: Simulating MEG spikes}

Here we simulate MEG spikes

\subsection{Steps: Surface Simulation}
Here we do a surface simulation with EEG.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

We look at the results of the previous sections, and we export them
